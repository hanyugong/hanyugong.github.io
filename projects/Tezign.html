However, current Chinese market lack trustful platform where you could find talented designers. Also, you have no idea how much you shall pay for a high-quality design. <span style="background-color:rgba(104, 93, 255, 0.4); ">The Startup Toolkit aims to introduce Tezign to more users, allows them to try a light version of the service and in the end attracts them to become long-term clients.</span> By understanding the typical user group, I defined the design goals for this project, and kept them in mind all the way through the design process.    </p>

                        <br>
                        <p>I started this small project with <span style="background-color:rgba(104, 93, 255, 0.4); ">experiencing the current Tezign website (both client-end and designer-end) a thousand times</span>. By doing so, I became familiar with the product functions and user flows.  Afterwards, I started to <span style="background-color:rgba(104, 93, 255, 0.4); ">summarize the key functions</span> and tried to simplify it as much as possible ------- the design goal is to make a handy mobile page on which users can learn our service in fragmented time periods. I could not go into details of the original product features because it is protected by NDA ( Patent ID: CN106682878A ).  </p>
                        
                        <p>Different from an independent mobile app, Wechat h5 page has short-term marketing purpose and aims to attract users within a short period of time. Therefore, in addition to simple and fast operation, I tried to make the interface as interesting as possible. Also, I did a lot <span style="background-color:rgba(104, 93, 255, 0.4); ">research work about competitors</span>, similar products and also successful Wechat h5 cases. I am proud that I managed to <span style="background-color:rgba(104, 93, 255, 0.4); ">integrated the brand story into this small product, so the product itself can serve as a social-media branding campaign.</span>  </p>

                        <br>
                         <p>Based on previous research, I began to plan the whole service flow involved in this product. <br>

                          <p>Comparing to design a comprehensive mobile app, this Wechat-based toolkit seemed to be simple at first. However, I soon realized I was wrong. I have experienced multiple design iterations throughout the process. There were endless meet-ups teams, and I kept asking feedbacks from bosses and colleagues. I also asked non-project related colleagues to conduct quick user tests.  </p><br>

                        <br> 
                        
                         <p>Working in a dynamic environment where DESIGN X TECH is highly valued was definitely as exciting experience. It was also the place where I started to design digital products for real-world business. Also, I gained valuable lessons by implementing multi-team projects. </p>
                         <p>Of course, I have improved my skills using various design & prototyping tools. However, I think the most important takeaways are more about "THINKING" instead of design implementations:</p>
                        <h3 style="font-weight: 700; color:#7A89FF">TO THINK FROM A HIGHER LEVEL</h3><br>
                        <p>A designer shall not only think as a designer, instead, understanding higher level strategies is an important step.   Why shall we make this new design? what role does this product have comparing to the main product and service of the company? what additional business value can this product bring to the company? Can it be implemented within a short period of time ..... All these questions can influence the design outcome. </p>
                         <h3 style="font-weight: 700; color:#7A89FF">NEVER BE AFRAID OF EXPERIMENTING</h3><br>
                        <p>While the design must take practical situations into consideration, experimenting innovative ideas within a reasonable time period still worth a shot.  </p>
                         <h3 style="font-weight: 700; color:#7A89FF">ALWAYS BE READY TO PRESENT</h3><br>
                        <p>When I was doing design projects at school, presentations only come on regular basis with prior notifications. However, that is not the case at work. I need to be ready all the time to explain and present my work to my colleagues. Also, I directly held a cross-team meeting at which I had to make a public presentation in front of 10 people. These experiences trained my ability to communicate ideas with others and make improvements afterwards. </p>
                         <h3 style="font-weight: 700; color:#7A89FF">EVERY DETAIL MATTERS, EVEN WHEN WORKING FAST</h3><br>
                        <p>I still clearly remembered what my big boss, who was the CEO of this startup, said to me when he reviewed my work the other day: if your idea worths 100 points, a rough demo maybe can only convey 50%-60%, then how can you persuade others to believe in your product？If you try your best to make every detail perfectly demonstrated, you can probably make people understand 90% of it. In other words, even if your initial idea only worths 80 points, you still can get 72.  </p>
