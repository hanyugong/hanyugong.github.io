                        <p>This project started from non-intrusive observations, user interviews and online surveys. In-store order and mobile-app order are two main ways of Starbucks purchase. However, though Starbucks mobile app is gaining its popularity, its main strength lies in pre-order and mobile payment. <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">Loyal Starbucks members are more likely to use the app as a payment method, while a majority of occasional visitors still make most of their coffee orders in physical stores.</span>  </p>

                         <p>According to our detailed task analysis, one of the biggest concerns among customers is how to place an order as smooth and fast as possible. Long waiting time during peak hours, occasional mistaken orders or names and unfamiliarity with the menu cause "congestion" in stores. </p>

                        <br>
                         <p>As we took a closer look on customers at Starbucks through a second-round observation and contextual inquiries, we noticed that there were three groups of people who held different likes and dislikes for this world-famous coffee shop:<br>
                             &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp(1) <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">Coffee addict: </span>loyal Starbucks members who go to the shop nearly every day<br>

                             To better understand users needs and draw design implications, I integrated personas and empathy maps to depict three typical characters:  </p>

                        <p>Based on the conclusion we drew from previous research, we have decided that our design shall follow at least one of the following design implications:
                            <br>- It shall enable <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">more engaging and faster ordering process </span>
                            <br>- It shall help consumers, especially those unfamiliar with products,  to <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">understand the menu better</span>
                            <br>- It shall provide <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">more convenient customization methods</span>
                            <br>- It shall help to <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">match orders and consumers more efficiently</span></p><br>

                         <p>Through a long round of concept generation, we were able to categorize over 30 concepts into trends and specific problems they were solving. After taking these concepts, recombining them, and comparing them against our own criteria, such as price, feasibility, and and ease of use, we brought ourselves down to three concepts we were prepared to make more refined sketches: a stand-alone kiosk, audio communication, and an innovative representation of a name. </p>
                        
                        <p> 10 feedback sessions were organized to help us understand how users think about the concepts. Most of the participants were glad to see these new options for Starbucks purchasing, though each idea had its own pros and cons. It seems that among the three ideas, audio playback was the least popular one because users really care about their privacy and they thought hearing their own voices make things more uncomfortable.  </p>

                        <p>We believed that a small series of in-store kiosks will be the most appropriate solution based on previous findings. We decided to combine the 1st and 2nd design idea to create a more detailed wireframe for the kiosk.  </p><br>

                          <p>We had 6 participants for our wireframe feedback sessions. All the feedbacks were documented in a consistent way following the planned questions, based on which I iterated the design. The overall feedback was rather positive, both Starbucks addicts and occasional visitors would like to try the kiosk in store. "I would do anything to avoid awkward communication with baristas." said one of our test participants. </p>

                             <br><br><span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">Heuristic evaluation</span> was implemented before user tests, based on which we modified some small non-task related flaws on the interface.
                             <br><span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">The usability testing</span> allowed us to observe users’ interaction with the kiosk, quantify the quality of our design through questionnaires, and get more insights into users' feelings about the use of the kiosk through follow-up questions and interviews.</p><br>

                         <p>Designing digital interface for a kiosk is very different from mobile app or web design, especially when Starbucks already has a mature branding language system. I tried my best to make the interface and interactions as simple as possible, and to innovate without breaking existing Starbucks rules.   
                             <br><br>Also, this is the first project that I have experienced systematic usability testings along with the design process. <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">Listening to users' voice and observing users behavior can really bring benefits to design iteration</span>, and more importantly, downsize the gap between designers and users. I began to understand the science behind user-centered design through practice: <span style="background-color: #C0F4D8">every design decision shall be made based on solid reasons instead of abstract aesthetic preferences or imagination.</span> I am glad that my team was able to get a large amount of information from our final hybrid prototype that turned into a substantial amount of qualitative and quantitative feedback. If we had chance to get a larger sample size of participants, we would be able to gain more quantitative data to support/doubt our design decisions.</p>
